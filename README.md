# Estimation of Time period of RCC frame with masonry wall using ANN
TIme period of a structure is estimated by modelling structure as FEM model in either SAP 2000 or Staad Pro ignoring presence of masonry wall because modelling masonry wall involves a lot of computation and it is time consuming. Even many National and International standard empirical equations doesnt include effect of masonry wall in the frame. By ignoring the effect of masonry wall, we are simply doing conservative design for our structure.
 When it comes requalification of old structures we are left with no option of conservative design. So accurate estimation of time period is neccessary for requalification of structures.
 
 In this program, ANN model is developed to predict the time period of masonry filled RCC structure by training with availble opensource data. Develoepd model generated results with a good level of accuracy.
